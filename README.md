# VR-Demo

## About

This project Unity Steam VR Assets developed for the WC-WAVE Virtual Watershed Client. The assets are packaged into a demo scene where users can explore a virtual environment. They can move about by walking in the VR space, by teleporting using a "point-and-click teleporter" as well as a "mini-map teleporter." The assets also demostrate how to interact with objects in VR.


## Functionality

### Point-and-click teleporter

Teleport with the trigger while nothing is in your hand (or an arrow is).

### Mini-map teleporter

Toggle the handheld map by pressing down on the lower half of the touchpad. Handheld map can be used to teleport. Hold the trigger and point at the map.

### Other usage notes

Float by pressing down on the upper half of the touchpad.

Pick up useable objects off the table by pressing the grip buttons while holding the controller over the object. To pick up cubes, hold controller over cube and hold grip buttons until you want to let go of the cube.

To use held objects, press the trigger on the hand you're holding it in.
